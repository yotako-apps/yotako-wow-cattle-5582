            <p class="style72">At about this time of year, some months after New Year’s resolutions have been made and kept, or made and neglected, one thing is undeniable: we have a chance to learn and grow every day, no matter what we did not do yesterday or neglected
                to do last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Use of This Moment&nbsp;&nbsp;Making use of this moment, of the NOW, is a principle that stress management experts, psycho-therapists, meditators, and many authors such as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Jon Kabat-Zinn,
                and Eckhart Tolle have been talking and writing about for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only moment, the only life we have is in the NOW. What happened a few moments or several years ago is gone, what will happen this evening, or next month when
                we go on holidays is not here yet. Thus, if we live our lives thinking about past events or future possibilities, we are literally not living our life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing Flow&nbsp;&nbsp;Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi wrote a wonderful little
                book “Finding Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience” which addresses the issue of the importance of remaining in the moment, of the inestimable value we can find in those activities that cause us to “go into flow”, or lose our sense
                of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you discover what those activities are in your life, they need to be developed. Is it music, writing, or painting, or another creative activity? Is it being outdoors and practicing some kind of sport? Is it working
                on your computer or editing digital movies? Perhaps you are an avid reader, observer of documentaries about the hunch-backed camel, or participant in the Dakar rally and spend all year preparing. Whatever it is, cultivate it, make it expand
                in your life, and use it to enrich yourself. These activities are priceless ways of being – and remaining – in the now.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurture the Now at All Times&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in the now needs to be nurtured
                at all times. The more time you spend in the now, the more you actually live your life. Yesterday – and even just one short hour ago – is gone. Tomorrow is not yet here. Now is what we have. Now is the time of our life. Now is the time
                for living. Start by gently bringing yourself to this moment more and more often on a daily basis. If you are at work, with your partner or family, or simply running errands, become aware of what you are doing, actually participate consciously
                in your daily activities … don’t just get through them in order to be able to do something else later on. Doing that means that you have lost this moment forever. Stay in the Now&nbsp;&nbsp;By staying in the now, notice how you seem to
                have more time. Notice how you feel less stressed. Notice all that is potentially enjoyable, positive, or could be a latent learning experience in the now moment. Even if you are going through a difficult situation, remain aware and in
                the now in order to better understand what is happening and in order to get to know yourself more intimately by observing your feelings, thoughts, and possible reactions. Live here rather than in the past or the future. The more you practice,
                the more it will become a habit, and the more you will truly live your life, rather than just live on memories of past glories or future hopes and plans.</p>

                        <p class="style81">You’ve heard the expression, “Just believe it and it will come.” Well, technically, that is true, however, ‘believing’ is not just thinking that you can have it; it is also feeling that it is possible. When we believe that we can
                            “have it,” that means we have no doubt in receiving it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the formula for Deliberate Attraction:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Identify Desire&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Raise the Vibration (feeling)&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Allow it&nbsp;&nbsp;the
                            allowing of your desire can come to you very quickly providing you have no resistance to receiving it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance = Doubt&nbsp;&nbsp;When you remove the ‘doubt’ that you can have what you want, you are allowing and
                            that is how it can come to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools for allowing:&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of tools, techniques and strategies that can help you remove the doubt (resistance). Here is one that I like best.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask
                            yourself this question:&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there anyone on the planet doing or having what you desire?”&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your desire is to attract your ideal client, or your ideal relationship, then you could ask yourself:
                            “Is there anyone on the planet who has attracted their ideal client?”&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are millions of people on the planet who have attracted their ideal clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THIS FEELS POSSIBLE!&nbsp;&nbsp;And when
                            it feels possible, you have removed doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you remove the doubt, the universal Law of Attraction can bring your desires to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the formula for Deliberate Attraction, spend most of
                            your time “Allowing,” as it determines how quickly, or slowly, your desires will come to you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="style83">Motivation is the key to positivity in our lives. If we were not motivated enough, we would just not have the will in us to go about our daily lives. Its motivation that helps us get through the most mundane things – motivation for
                        working harder, motivation to have a healthy relationship, motivation to earn more, motivation to have a happy family. And yet sometimes we find ourselves lacking in motivation. Ithink we have all had days when getting out of bed
                        to get ready to go to work seemed like a Herculean task. Sometimes lack of motivation can really bring people down, and hinder their efficiency and ability. This may lead to frustrations and further breakdown of communication between
                        people. However, if you intercept this lack of motivation timely, you have help at hand. Go for hypnotherapy for motivation to get the zest in life back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypnotherapy is intrinsically related to the concept of motivation,
                        and can help you in every walk of life. From motivation in sports, to business; from quitting smoking to losing weight, hypnotherapy for motivation could help you out. But here’s the catch: you can think of successfully motivating
                        yourself only once you have your goals identified. Identification of a goal is very necessary before you start motivating yourself. Motivation is all about helping you realize your true potential, sometimes this potential gets
                        thwarted by certain experiences in our lives. Hypnotherapy for motivation works towards removing those mental blockages by connecting with your subconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypnotherapy is based on the formula of auto suggestion, and
                        it works on deeper levels than one can imagine. Hypnotherapy for motivation converses with your subconscious mind, and urges it to alter self-perception and self – image. Unknown to us, our subconscious is largely responsible for
                        the way we think and react; if we train it to think on a different line, no doubt the accompanying behavior would change too. It understands the true potential that lies within us, and taps into it. Through gentle affirmations
                        such as “I can do it”, it retrains your mind into believing that nothing is impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my practice at Oxfordshire, I have helped clients deal with a variety of issues through hypnotherapy for motivation. Some wanted
                        to perform better at work, while others needed motivation to keep a relationship going. Some wanted to perform better at sports, while others at studies. The underlying theory of hypnotherapy is based on motivation, and we need
                        it in every walk of life. However, we need to have our goals clear in our minds for the hypnotherapy to be successful. Hypnotherapy for motivation lets you focus on the particular task at hand, however if the task is undefined,
                        hypnotherapy will be rendered ineffective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypnotherapy for motivation can seem to be too simple a solution for these problems; however you will be surprised at their effectiveness. Once you started this journey of self
                        discovery, you will see the changes in a short time. Through altering self-perception and self-image, hypnotherapy gives you a whole new view of the world. From being a procrastinating person, you can go on to become a self starter.
                        So define your goals now, and dive into the vast sea of your subconscious mind through hypnotherapy. The pearls you will find there will take care of every situation and possibility in life. Happy Self Discovery!</p>
